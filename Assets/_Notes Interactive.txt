//SORT OUT YOUR REPOSITORY

//time travel right into the future to get paradox error


//Paradox for unexpected items


//Item timeline
//Interpolate item position from within items

//Actions longer than 1 tick
//Undo for these

//Remember symbols and experiment

//Experiment with time line glitchiness


//Nested items are going to require more work
//-observations for example, probably others

//----//Needed things
//Transition from time travel directly to paradox state

//----//Pretty things
//Rotat characters based on playhead instead of absolute time
//Fix blend speed when holding down wait key or similar
//Timeline blink when time travelling
//Timeline not strictly following playhead
//Offset carried items so they look seperate even with two of the same
//Items being picked up flicker for one frame
//Character flicker for one frame when undoing out of paradox state, probably rotation chaos
//Paradox meeting while carrying item

//---//Tidy things
//Parenting of objects
//Remove GetLocationAtTime() from character

//----//Design considerations
//Only carry one item? swap instead of pick up multiples

//----//Tech considerations
//Consider character profile for comparison
//Room profile?
//Initial items inside on items could be done smarter
//relationship between items could also be smarter
//relationship between items and character could also be smarter
//Current item on ActionPickup and ActionDrop not good
//Maybe remove perform actions from SetActionState?
