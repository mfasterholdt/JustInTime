//Consider character profile for comparison
//Room profile?

//Initial items inside on items could be done smarter
//relationship between items could also be smarter
//relationship between items and character could also be smarter


//Current item on ActionPickup and ActionDrop not good


//Item timeline
//Interpolate item position from within items

//Actions longer than 1 tick
//Undo for these

//Check observations in update all the time
//Maybe remove check from action state

//Experiment with warnings
//Run all actions to the end and collect paradoxes
//Only act on paradoxes when time is past it
//Otherwise paradoxes are just potential and collected for warnings

//Remember crossing is currently disabled


//Scrub should probably not cause paradoxes only foreshadow and inform
//Show missing objects as showdows
//Show unexpectects as warnings


//----//Pretty things
//Rotat characters based on playhead instead of absolute time
//Fix blend speed when holding down wait key or similar
//Sort out parenting of objects and characters
//Timeline blink when time travelling
//Timeline not strictly following playhead
